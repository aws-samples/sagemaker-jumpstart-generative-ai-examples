This is an application for a writ of certiorari and prohibition under article 32 of the Constitution of India The petitioner, who is the President of the All India Hindu Mahasabha since December, 1949, was served with an order of externment dated the gist of March, 1950, that night By that order he is directed by the District Magistrate, Delhi, not to remain in the Delhi District, and immediately to remove himself from the Delhi District and not to return to the District The order was to continue in force for three months By another order of the Madhya Bharat Government he was directed to reside in Nagpur That order has been recently cancelled The petitioner disputes the validity of the first order on the ground that the East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949, under which the order was made, is an infringement of his fundamental right given under article 19 (1) (d) of the Constitution of India He further contends that the grounds of the order served on him are vague, insufficient and incomplete According to him the object of the externment order passed by the District Magistrate, Delhi, was to suppress political opposition to the policy of the Government in respect of Pakistan and the Muslim League.

The Court will consider whether the restrictions put by the impugned legislation on the exercise of the right are reasonable or not The question whether the provisions of the Act provide reasonable safe guards against the abuse of the power given to the executive authority to administer the law is not relevant for the true interpretation of the clause The Court, on either interpretation, will be entitled to consider whether the re strictions on the right to move throughout India, i.e., both as regards the territory and the duration, are reasonable or not The law providing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by article 19 may contain substantive provisions as well as procedural provisions While the reasonableness of the restrictions has to be considered with regard to the exercise of the right, it does not necessarily exclude from the consideration of the Court the question of reasonableness of the procedural part of the law.

The petitioner argues that the order was served to him in breach of the law.The petitioners argument is based on the assumption that the Provincial Government when making the order will not perform its duty and may abuse the provisions of the section In my opinion, it is improper to start with such an assumption and decide the legality of an Act on that basis Abuse of the power given by a law sometimes occurs; but the validity of the law cannot be contested because of such an apprehension.The petitioner also argues that there is no provision in the Act for furnishing grounds of externment to the citizen.

The order is made because the activities of the petitioner are likely to prove prejudicial to the maintenance of law and order and the grounds specified have a direct bearing on that conclusion of the District Magistrate I therefore think that this contention of the petitioner must be rejected The result is that the petition fails and is dismissed.The petitioners main contention is that the particular provision of the East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949, under which the District Magistrate of Delhi purported to make the externment order, became void and ceased to be operative after the new Consti tution came into force, by reason of these provisions being inconsistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed under article 19 (1) (d) of the Constitution read with clause (5) of the same article.

The right to move freely throughout the territory of India is not absolute The extent to which it could be curtailed by legislation is laid down in clause (5) of article 19 which runs as follows: "Nothing in sub clauses (d), (e) and (f) of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of any of the rights conferred by the said sub clauses either in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe.".The primary question which requires consideration is, whether the impugned legislation which apparently seems to be in conflict with the fundamental right enunciated in article 19 (1) (d) of the Consitution is protected by clause (5) of the article, under which a law would be valid if it imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right in the interests of the general public.

The reasonableness of the restrictions imposed by a law may arise from the substan tive part of the law as much as from its procedural portion The question of reasonableness of the restric tions imposed by a law may arise as much from the substan tive part of the law as from its procedural portion The learned Attorney General suggested that the word "reasonable" in clause (5) of article 19 goes with "restrictions" and not with "law." He could not be more correct The reasonableness of the restrictions which a legislation might impose upon the exercise of the right of free movement requires careful examination The provisions of the impugned Act, Mr Banerjees main contention, are based on similar principle.

The Provincial Government has been given unlimited authority in this respect and they can keep the order in force as long as they chose to do so As regards orders made by a District Magistrate, the period indeed has been fixed at three months, but even here the Provincial Government is competent to extend it to any length of time by means of a special order The law does not fix any maximum period beyond which the order cannot continue; and the fact that the Act itself would expire in August, 1951, is, in my opinion, not a relevant matter for consideration in this connection at all I have no hesi tation in holding that the provision of sub section (3) of section 4 is manifestly unreasonable and cannot be supported on any just ground.
