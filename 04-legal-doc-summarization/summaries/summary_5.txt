The context is a civil appeal filed by Bakshi Tek Chand and others against the judgment and decree dated 12th October, 1944, of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad (Allsop and Malik JJ.) in First Appeal No 374 of 1941 arising out of a Decree dated 31st July, 1941, of the Court of the Civil Judge, Moradabad, in Original Suit No 9 of 1941 The appeal was filed on the basis that the defendants were in possession of the disputed property at all material times and that on 480 Shanker Lal s death in 1884 his daughter Mst Mohan Dei (the plaintiffs  grandmother) succeeded to a limited estate The reversion opened out on her death in October 1929 and the plaintiffs are entitled as the next reversioners, for Mst Mohan Dei s son Shri Kishan Das predeceased her The defendants claim that the plaintiffs are bound by this award and are in any event estopped The plaintiffs lost in the first Court but won in the High Court The defendants appeal The first question is about the nature of the award The defendants say that it gave Mst.

The context is a legal case where the parties are Brijlal, Shanker Lal, Kishan Lal, and Mohan Dei Brijlal claimed to have an interest in the property in question, which was owned by Shanker Lal and Kishan Lal He claimed that he was joint with Shanker Lal and so, on Shanker Lal s death, he became entitled to the property However, Kishan Lal did not claim through him but had an independent title as reversioner to Shanker Lal It was also claimed that if Kishan Lal was not bound, the plaintiffs would not be either.

Mst Mohan Dei claimed maintenance from Mst Brijlal, but he did not have a right to the estate He induced Mst Mohan Dei to believe that he would succeed as the reversioner, which led to her accepting the award and parting with an appreciable portion of the estate He obtained a substantial advantage to which he would not otherwise have been entitled and enjoyed the benefit of it for the rest of his life.

Brijlal admitted in the course of the argument that he had no right to the lands awarded to Mst Mohan Dei He did so because of an assertion of fact, namely his recognition and admission of the existence of facts which would give Mst Mohan Dei an absolute interest in the lands There can be no doubt that she acted to her detriment and that Brijlal would have been estopped The nature of the dispute and the de scription of it given in the award show that there was considerable doubt, and certainly much dispute, about the true state of affairs Even if the arbitrator was wholly wrong and even if he had no power to decide as he did, it was open to both sides to accept the decision and by their acceptance recognise the existence of facts which would in law give the other an absolute estate in the properties they agreed to divide among themselves and did divide That, in our opinion, is a representation of an existing fact or set of facts Each consequently would be estopped as against the other and Brijlal in particular would have been estopped from denying the existence of facts which would give Mst.

Mst Mohan Dei died in 1889 Kishan Lal was estopped for the reasons given above Kishan Lal s inaction over these years with full knowledge of the facts, as is evident from the deposition of D.W 2, Dhiyan Singh, whose testimony is uncontradicted, and his acceptance of the estate with all its consequential benefits, unquestionably creates an estoppel in him This witness tells us that 488 "Kishanlal always accepted this award and acted upon it " He qualifies this in cross examination by saying that Kishan Lal had also objected to it but the witness did not know whether that was before or after Mst Mohan Dei s death The documents filed show it was after, so there is no reason why the main portion of his statement which is uncontradicted, and which could have been contradicted, should not be accepted.

In the case of Rangasami Gounden vs Nachiappa Goun den (1), their Lordships held that even if it was possible to assign this 13 gundas with certainty to the 12 gundas it by no means followed that the plaintiffs admitted that fact nor would that necessarily have given them a benefit under the compromise They had the right to contest the 490 position and gamble on the possibility of being able to prove the contrary Their Lordships added " Unless the plaintiffs  individual conduct makes it unjust that they should have a place among Bajrangi Lal s reversioners their legal rights should have effect " In the other case, Kishan Lal took possession of his father s property he held by virtue of the award and under no other title, and for forty years he continued to derive benefit from it Accordingly, he would have been estopped even if he had claimed in a differ ent character as reversioner after the succession opened out It was conceded that if the estoppel against Kishan Lal enured after October 1929, then the plaintiffs, who claim through Kishan Lal, would also be estopped.
