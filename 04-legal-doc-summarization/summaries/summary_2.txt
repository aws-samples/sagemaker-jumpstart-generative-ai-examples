This is an application under article 32 of the Constitution of India for a writ of certiorari and prohibition The petitioner is the printer and publisher of an English weekly of Delhi called the Organizer, and the respondent is the Chief Commissioner of Delhi The order issued by the respondent, in exercise of powers conferred on him by section 7 (1) (c) of the East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949, which has been extended to the Delhi Province, requires the petitioner to submit for scrutiny, in duplicate, all communal matter and news and views about Pakistan including photographs and cartoons other than those derived from official sources or supplied by the news agencies, viz., Press Trust of India, United Press of India and United Press of America to the Provincial Press Officer, or in his absence, to Superintend ent of Press Branch at his office at 5, Alipur Road, Civil Lines, Delhi, between the hours 10 a.m and 5 p.m on work ing days.

The petitioner is a printer and publisher of an English weekly of Delhi called Organizer The Chief Commission er, Delhi, has directed the petitioner to submit for scrutiny, in duplicate, all communal matter and news and views about Pakistan including photographs and cartoons other than those derived from official sources or supplied by the news agencies The petitioner is to issue prohibition notices to the Chief Commissioner, Delhi, with a view to examine and review the legality of and "restrain the operation" of and "quash" the order made by him on the 2nd March, 1950, under the impugned section, directing them "to submit for scrutiny, in duplicate, all communal matter and news and views about Pakistan including photographs and cartoons other than those derived from official sources or supplied by the news agencies.

Maintaining law and order in the province is the responsibility of the state legislature Public tranquillity and order are affected by anything that disturbs public tranquillity or security of the state Public safety is equivalent to security of the State.

The argument advanced on behalf of the petitioners is that since the Act has been passed in exercise of the power granted by the expression "public order," used in the Government of India Act, which is a general term of wide import, and since it purports to provide for the maintenance of public order, its provisions are intended or are liable to be used for all cases of breaches of public order, be they small or insig nificant breaches or those of a grave or serious nature This is, in my opinion, approaching the case from a wrong angle The Act is a piece of special legislation providing for special measures and the central idea dominating it is public safety and maintenance of public order in a situation requiring special measures.

The learned Chief Justice held that the test laid down by him was not applicable in India where the offence under section 124A of the Indian Penal Code should be construed with reference to the words used in that section The decision of Gwyer C.J held the field for several years until the Privy Council, dealing with a case under the Defence of India Rules, expressed the view in King Emper or vs Sadashiv Narayan Bhalerao(3) that the test laid down by the learned Chief Justice was not applicable in India where the offence under section 124A of the Indian Penal Code should be construed with reference to the words used in that section They also added : "The word sedition  does not occur either in section 124A or in the Rule; it is only found as a marginal note to section 124A, and is not an operative part of the section, but merely provides the name by which the crime defined in the section will be known (1) [1868] 11 Cox c.c 44 (2) [1886] 16 cox 855.

The context is other, and not capable of being marked off by perfectly definite boundaries All of them have in common one feature, namely, that the normal tranquillity of a civilised society is in each of the cases mentioned disturbed either by actual force or at least by the show and threat of it Another class of offences against public tranquillity are those in which no actual force is either employed or displayed, but in which steps are taken tending to cause it These are the formation of secret societies, seditious conspiracies, libels or words spoken Under these two heads all offences against the internal public tranquillity of the State may be arranged " This passage brings out two matters with remarkable clarity.

The context is a threat to public law and order The action which it is proposed to take against the petitioners is necessary for the purpose of preventing or combating activities prejudi cial to public safety or the maintenance of public order.
