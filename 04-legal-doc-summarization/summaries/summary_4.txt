This case is about a weekly journal called Cross Roads printed and published in Bombay The Government of Madras, the respondents herein, in exer cise of their powers under section 9 (1 A) of the Madras Maintenance of Public Order Act, 1949 (hereinafter referred to as the impugned Act) purported to issue an order No MS 1333 dated 1st March, 1950, whereby they imposed a ban upon the entry and circulation of the journal in that State The order was published in the Fort St George Gazette and the notification ran as follows : "In exercise of the powers conferred by section 9 (I A) of the Madras Maintenance of Public Order Act, 1949 (Madras Act XXIII of 1949) His Excellency the Governor of Madras, being satisfied that for the purpose of securing the public safety and the maintenance of public order, it is necessary so to do, hereby prohibits, with effect on and from the date of publication of this order in the Fort St George Gazette the entry into or the circulation, sale or distribution in the State of Madras or any part thereof of the newspaper entitled Cross Roads an English weekly published at Bombay.

The order would be a violation of the petitioners fundamental right under article 19 (1) (a), unless section 9 (1 A) of the impugned Act under which it was made is saved by the reservations mentioned in clause (2) of article 19 which (omitting immaterial words regarding laws relating to libel, slander, etc., with which we are not concerned in this case).The question accordingly arises whether, the impugned Act, in so far as it purports by section 9 (1 A) to authorise the Provincial Government "for the purpose of securing the public safety or the maintenance of public order, to prohibit or regulate the entry into (1) ; (2) ; 598 or the circulation, sale or distribution in the Province of Madras or any part thereof of any document or class of documents" is a "law relating to any matter which undermines the security of or tends to overthrow the State.

The Public Safety Act, 1875, which was enacted to secure public safety, does not include the securing of public health as one of its objectives However, the Act may be taken to relate to matters affecting the security of the State rather than trivial offences like rash driving The Government of India Act, 1935, nowhere used the expression "security of the State" though it made provision under section 57 for dealing with crimes of violence intended to overthrow the Government.

The word "sedition" was deleted from article 13 (2) of the Draft Constitution prepared by the Drafting Committee In this connection it may be recalled that the Federal Court had, in defining sedition in Niharendu Dutt Majumdar vs The King Emperor (1), held that "the acts or words complained of must either incite to disorder or must be such as to satisfy reasonable men that that is their intention or tendency", but the Privy Council overruled that decision and emphatically reaffirmed the view expressed in Tilaks case (1) to the effect that "the offence "consisted in exciting or attempting to excite in others certain bad feelings towards the Government and not in exciting or attempting to excite mutiny or rebellion, or any sort of actual disturbance, great or small.".The deletion of the word "sedition" from article 13 (2) of the Draft Constitution shows that criticism of Government exciting disaffection or bad feel ings towards it is not to be regarded as a justifying ground for restricting the freedom of expression and of the press, unless it is such as to undermine the security of or tend to overthrow the State.

The order is quashed as the restriction allowed by article 19 (2) of the Constitution, i.e., the imposition of restrictions on the freedom of speech and expression only in cases where danger to the State is involved, cannot be held to be constitutional and valid to any extent The application is allowed and the order of the respondents prohibiting the entry and circulation of the petitioner s journal in the State of Madras is hereby quashed.
