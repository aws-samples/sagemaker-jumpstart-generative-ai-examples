This is an appeal against a judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in an income tax matter and it raises the question whether munici pal property tax and urban immoveable property tax payable under the relevant Bombay Acts are allowable deductions under section 9 (1) (iv) of the Indian Income tax Act The assessee company is an investment company deriving its income from properties in the city of Bombay For the assessment year 1940 41 the net income of the assessee under the head "property" was computed by the Income tax Officer in the sum of Rs 6,21,764 after deducting from gross rents certain payments The company had paid during the relevant year Rs 1,22,675 as municipal property tax and Rs 32,760 as urban property tax Deduction of these two sums was claimed under the provisions of section 9 the Act Out of the first item a deduction in the sum of Rs 48,572 was allowed on the ground that this item represented tenants  burdens paid by the assessee, otherwise the claim was disal lowed.

The context is a statement of the annual rateable value of the building and the maintenance of an assessment book in which entries have to be made every official year of all buildings in the city, their rateable value, the names of persons primarily liable for payment of the property tax on such buildings and of the amount for which each building has been assessed.Section 156 provides for the maintenance of an assessment book in which entries have to be made every official year of all buildings in the city, their rateable value, the names of persons primarily liable for payment of the property tax on such buildings and of the amount for which each building has been assessed.Section 167 lays down that the assess ment book need not be prepared every official year but public notices shall be given in accordance with sections 160 to 162 every year and the provisions of the said sections and of sections 163 and 167 shall be applicable each year.These sections lay down a procedure for hearing objections and complaints against entries in the assessment book From these provisions it is clear that the liability for the tax is determined at the beginning of each official year and the tax is an annual one.

The context is the property taxes due under section 212 of the Municipal Act The provisions of the Act affording facilities for the discharge of the liability do not in any way affect their true nature and character If the annual liability is not discharged in the manner laid down by section 197, can it be said that the property cannot be sold for recovery of the whole amount due for the year? The answer to this query can only be in the affirmative, i.e., that the proper ty is liable to sale.The claim was that the taxes were not within the ambit of the clause The Court held that the clause was not meant to cover municipal taxes which are made a charge on the property The claim was rejected.

The House of Lords held that the fact that certain payments were contingent and variable in amount did not affect their character of being annual payments and that the word, "annual" must be taken to have the quality of being recurrent or being capable of recurrence.Cunard s Trustees vs Inland Revenue Commissioners (2) was held in favour of the appellants.Mamad Keyi vs Commissioner of Income tax, Madras (3) was followed in Gappumal Kanhaiya Lal vs Commissioner of Incometax (1) which took a correct view of this matter and the reasoning given therein has our approval.Allahabad High Court (1) (2) [1948] 1 A.E.R 150 (3) I.L.R (4) I.L.R 563 in Gappumal Kanhaiya Lal vs Commissioner of Incometax (1) (the connected appeal) was allowed.
